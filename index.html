<p>Chess is a two-player board game that involes checkmationg your opponent's king as your main objective. The game consists of <u>6 types of pieces</u> :
            <div style="font-size:20px;"<br>
        - King (♚) <br>
        - Queen (♛) <br>
        - Rook (♜) <br>
        - Bishop (♝) <br>
        - Knight (♞) <br>
        - Pawn (♟) <br>
        </div> <br>
   It is a very interesting and challenging game for all ages and levels.  </p>   


<div style="text-align:center;background-color:orange;"><h2>History of Chess</h2></span></div>
<div>
<p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly <i>1500 years</i> to its earliest known predecessor, called <b>"Chaturanga"</B>, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to southern Europe. The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19th century, modern chess tournament play began, and the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess Federation. In 1997, an <u><b>IBM supercomputer</b> beat <B>Garry Kasparov</b>, the then world chess champion</u>, in the famous Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of computer domination. Since then, computer analysis – which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market – has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player accessible to the public.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;background-color:orange;"><h2> Rules of Chess</h2></div>
<p><small>
Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8) and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares. The colors of the sixty-four squares alternate between light and dark, and are referred to as "light squares" and "dark squares". The chessboard is placed so that each player has a white square in the near right hand corner, and the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram, with each queen on a square that matches its color.
</p><p>
Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: each player's pieces comprise one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. One player, referred to as White, controls the white pieces and the other player, Black, controls the black pieces; White is always the first player to move. The colors are chosen either by a friendly agreement, by a game of chance or by a tournament director. The players alternate moving one piece at a time (with the exception of castling, when two pieces are moved at the same time). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square, or one occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it and removing it from play. With one exception (en passant), all pieces capture opponent's pieces by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. </small>
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.1. King</h3></div>
<p>
When a king is under direct attack by one (or possibly two) of the opponent's pieces, the player is said to be in check. When in check, only moves that remove the king from attack are permitted. The player must not make any move that would place his king in check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there are no moves that remove the king from attack.</p>
<p>
The king can move only one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once in the game, each king is allowed to make a special double move, to castle. Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:

The player must never have moved both the king and the rook involved in castling.
There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.
The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces. As with any move, castling is illegal if it would place the king in check.
The king and the rook must be on the same rank (to exclude castling with a promoted pawn).</small>
</p><div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.2. Rook</h3><P>
    <small></div>
The rook moves any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally (it is also involved in the king's special move of castling).</small></p>

<div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.3. Bishop</h3><p></div>
<small>
The bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any direction diagonally. Note that a bishop never changes square color, therefore players speak about "light-squared" or "dark-squared" bishops.
</small></p>
<div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.4. Queen</h3></div>
<p><small>
The queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
</small></p>
<div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.5. Knight</h3></div>
<p><small>
The knight can jump over occupied squares and moves two spaces horizontally and one space vertically or vice versa, making an "L" shape. A knight in the middle of the board has eight squares to which it can move. Note that every time a knight moves, it changes square color.
</small></p>
<div style="text-align:center;background-color:cyan;"><h3>1.6. Pawns</h3></div>
<p><small>
Pawns have the most complex rules of movement: A pawn can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not moved yet, the pawn has the option of moving two squares forward, if both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot move backward. When such an initial two square advance is made that puts that pawn horizontally adjacent to an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn can capture that pawn "en passant" as if it moved forward only one square rather than two, but only on the immediately subsequent move. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently than they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them), but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. If a pawn advances all the way to its eighth rank, it is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. In practice, the pawn is almost always promoted to a queen.</small>
